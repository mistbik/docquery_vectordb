As I write this, the world faces ongoing economic, social, and\\ngeopolitical volatility. At the same time, we have entered a new age of AI that will fundamentally transform productivity for every\\nindividual, organization, and industry on earth, and help us address some of our most pressing challenges.\\nThis next generation of AI will reshape every software category and every business, including our own. Forty-eight years after its\\nfounding, Microsoft remains a consequential company because time and time again—from PC/Server, to W eb/Internet, to\\nCloud/Mobile—we have adapted to technological paradigm shifts. T oday, we are doing so once again, as we lead this new era.\\nAmid this transformation, our mission t o empow er ev ery per son and ev ery organization on the planet t o achiev e mor e remains\\nconstant. As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it\\nwill help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.\\nHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:\\nLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today—\\nincluding physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient\\neXperience Copilot.\\nMercado Libre  is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot, as the\\ncompany works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.\\nMercedes-Benz  is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure\\nOpenAI Service.\\nLumen T echnologies  is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value-added activities, by\\ndeploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.\\nNonprofit The Contingent  is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, P ower BI, and Azure, with an eye\\non using AI to amplify its work across the US.\\nAnd, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education  has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using\\nAzure AI.\\nTo build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while\\ninnovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know that maximum enterprise\\nvalue gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across\\nevery layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue\\ngrowth.\\nAs we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211 billion in revenue and\\nover $88 billion in operating income.\\nA NE W ERA OF AI\\nThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural language.\\nThe long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive human-computer interfaces—\\nkeyboards, mice, touch screens. W e believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—natural language—and will quickly go\\nbeyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around us.\\nThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things and\\norganized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it. This\\ngeneration of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or summarizing text, to detecting anomalies and\\nrecognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.\\nTogether, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our vision for\\nCopilot , an everyday AI companion. W e are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to\\nsummon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites\\ntoday, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.\\nAs a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. W e believe AI should be as empowering across\\ncommunities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed, with safety in mind from the\\noutset.\\nOUR OPPOR TUNIT Y\\nEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly what we’ve already\\nbegun to do:Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 2/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Infrastr uctur e\\nFour years ago, we first invested  in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference. T oday, it’s\\nbeing used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services, including one of the fastest-growing\\nconsumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection, is also using our infrastructure to\\nbuild its own breakthrough models.\\nMore broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their mission-critical\\napplications. W e continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains early when it comes to the long-\\nterm cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers.\\nData and AI\\nEvery AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our Intelligent\\nData Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value\\nand less time integrating their data estate. W e also introduced Microsoft F abric  this year, which unifies compute, storage, and\\ngovernance with a disruptive business model.\\nWith Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. W e offer the best selection of industry-\\nleading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service  broadly available, bringing together advanced\\nmodels, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000 organizations across industries are\\nalready using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose us  this summer as its preferred cloud to\\ncommercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI S tudio , we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground\\nthese models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help ensure they are deployed and used safely.\\nDigital and app innov ation\\nGitHub Copilot  is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster.\\nMore than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub\\nCopilot to code faster. W e also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X , which will bring\\nthe power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue\\nfor the first time this fiscal year.\\nWe’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows,\\ncreate apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in P ower Platform . More\\nthan 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in P ower Platform to date.\\nBusiness applications\\nWe are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365\\nCopilot , which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and\\nnotetaking. In fact, our own support agents  are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and\\nwithout having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform , we’re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate\\ndisruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot , sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems—\\nincluding both  Salesforce and Dynamics—to close more deals.\\nAll up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and finance and\\nsupply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.\\nIndustr y\\nAcross industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI. In\\nhealthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX Copilot . The\\napplication helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients. And Epic\\nwill integrate it  directly into its electronic health records system.\\nAnd, in retail, we introduced new tools  to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores.\\nModer n work\\nWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and\\nproductivity, with both our established applications like Office and T eams, as well as new apps like Designer, S tream, and Loop.\\nMicrosoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.\\nThis year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot , which combines next-generation AI with\\nbusiness data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at\\nwork. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial\\ncustomers later this year.\\nWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft T eams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. W e introduced a new version of\\nTeams  that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. W e also introduced Teams Premium  to\\nmeet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up, T eams usage surpassed 300 million monthly\\nactive users this year.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 3/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva  offers leaders a new way to build high-\\nperformance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active\\nusers.\\nSecur ity\\nAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our comprehensive, AI-\\npowered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot , we’re combining large language models with a domain-\\nspecific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of security\\noperations center productivity.\\nAll up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estates, and\\nour security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds and endpoint platforms.\\xa0\\nSearch, adv ertising, and news\\nWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser , which brings together search,\\nbrowsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat experience, and the\\nability to generate content. W e think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.\\nWe are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise , which offers commercial data\\nprotection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next-generation AI today.\\nAlthough it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the\\npast year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quarters.\\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us  as its exclusive technology and sales\\npartner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for\\na flexible partner to build and innovate with them.\\nLinkedIn\\nThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and finance, to software\\ndevelopment and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills. W e are using\\nAI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our\\nAI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the network.\\nAll up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the platform has\\nbecome to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.\\nGaming\\nIn gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, wherever, and\\nhowever they want. With Xbox Game P ass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. Content is the flywheel\\nbehind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was especially energizing to release Starfield  this fall to\\nbroad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first month post-launch alone.\\nEarlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming\\nmonths about how, together , we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.\\nDevices and cr eativity\\nFinally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot , which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last\\nmonth. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you are doing in the moment on\\nyour PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront. Overall, the number of devices running\\nWindows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with\\nAzure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.\\nOUR RESPONSIBILIT Y\\nAs we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new ones. T o do this,\\nwe focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era. For\\nus, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do—as we design\\nand develop products, shape business processes and policies, help our customers thrive, build partnerships, and more —always\\nasking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with them.\\nHow can w e exp and oppor tunity ?\\nFirst, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community, and country. And\\nalthough AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies, data,\\nand skills they need to benefit.\\nTo achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other civil society\\norganizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest challenges. This year, we providedAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 4/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='nonprofits  with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly 325,000 nonprofits used our cloud. And to help them\\ntap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for fundraising, marketing, and program delivery.\\nAI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the\\nskills for jobs  and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped 8.5 million people, including 2.7 million\\nthis year. W e’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and\\nwith nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our efforts.\\nFinally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI  in partnership with\\nLinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US. These events will be\\nreplicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. W e also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant\\nChallenge  to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this\\nnew generation of AI.\\nHow can w e ear n trust?\\nTo create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them.\\nFor us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity.\\xa0\\nOur commitment to responsible AI is not new. Since 2017, we’ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice, recognizing that trust\\nis never given but earned through action.\\nWe have translated our AI principles  into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and practices to support\\ncompliance. But internal programs aren’t enough. W e also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely,\\nincluding through our AI customer commitments  and services like Azure AI S tudio, with its content safety tooling and access to our\\nResponsible AI dashboard.\\nBuilding AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate for AI regulations\\nand governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint , which outlines concrete legal and policy\\nrecommendations for AI guardrails. W e are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments  developed with the US White House, and\\nproud of the six additional commitments we’ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety, security, and\\ntrust.\\nThe era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve\\ncyber-resilience. W e’ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure, detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and\\ncyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these attacks. Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced\\nmore than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft\\nDigital Defense R eport , sharing our learnings and security recommendations.\\nWe also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and\\nconduct, while respecting human rights. W e supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist\\nand violent and extremist content online. And through the W orld Economic Forum’s Global Coalition for Digital Safety, we co-led the\\ndevelopment of new global principles for digital safety.\\nProtecting customers’ privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever. W e’ve begun our phased rollout of\\nthe EU Data Boundary , supporting our commercial and public sector customers’ need for data sovereignty. And each month, more\\nthan 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard, making meaningful choices about how\\ntheir data is used.\\nHow can w e protect fundamental r ights?\\nIn an increasingly digital world, we have a responsibility to promote and protect people’s fundamental rights and address the\\nchallenges technology creates. For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility,\\nadvancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities.\\nIn 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are\\nconsequential to people’s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights. W e will continue to assess the impact of\\nour technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights—including\\nacross our global supply chain.\\nToday, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical services is increasingly\\ndependent on technology. That’s why we’ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable high-speed internet  to a quarter\\nof a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in Africa, by the end of 2025. Since 2017, we’ve helped bring\\ninternet access to 63 million people, a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies.\\nThis year, we also continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close\\nthe accessibility knowledge gap. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and\\naccessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning , Teach Access , and the Microsoft disability community.\\nIn addition, we’re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies—\\nenabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI. W e continued our efforts to promote racial equity  across Microsoft,\\nour ecosystem, and our communities, including our work to advance justice reform through data-driven insights. And we provided\\nsupport in response to eight humanitarian disasters, including committing $540 million of support to those who have been impacted\\nby the W ar in Ukraine.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 5/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Finally, recognizing AI’s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action, we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action\\nprojects. T ogether with our partners, we’re building the capabilities to identify at-risk communities , estimate seasonal hunger, predict\\nmalnutrition, and assist in disease identification.\\nHow can w e adv ance sustainability ?\\nClimate change is the defining issue of our generation, and addressing it requires swift, collective action and technological innovation.\\nWe are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same. That means taking responsibility for our\\noperational footprint and accelerating progress through technology.\\nWe continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally. T o meet the urgent need, this must be a decade of innovation\\nand decisive action—for Microsoft, our customers, and the world.\\nIn our latest Environmental Sustainability R eport , we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon, water,\\nwaste, and ecosystems. In 2022, our overall carbon emissions declined by 0.5 percent while our business grew. Addressing scope 3\\nemissions, which account for the vast majority of our emissions, is arguably our ultimate challenge—one we’ll continue to tackle\\nthrough our supply chain, policy advances, and industry-wide knowledge-sharing.\\nWe’ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, one of five pillars  on our path to becoming\\nwater positive. And in our pursuit to be zero waste, we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and\\ndiverted over 12,000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators.\\nWe also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth’s ecosystems. W e’ve contracted to protect\\n17,268 acres of land, over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Of that, 12,270 acres—the equivalent of approximately\\n7,000 soccer fields—were designated as permanently protected.\\nTechnology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. That’s why we’re accelerating our\\ninvestment in more efficient datacenters, clean energy, enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability  and Planetary\\nComputer, and green software practices. T o date, through our Climate Innovation Fund , we’ve allocated more than $700 million to a\\nglobal portfolio of 50+ investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems.\\nFinally, we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis. W e expanded our AI for Good Lab  in Egypt and\\nKenya to improve climate resilience for the continent. And, together with our partners, we launched Global R enewables W atch, a first-\\nof-its-kind living atlas that aims to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind installations, allowing users to evaluate progress\\ntoward a clean energy transition.\\nAlthough this new era promises great opportunity, it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours. As we pursue our\\nfour commitments, we focus on transparency—providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with\\ncustomers and partners. Our annual Impact Summary  shares more about our progress and learnings this year, and our Reports Hub\\nprovides detailed reports on our environmental data, political activities, workforce demographics, human rights work, and more.\\nOUR CUL TURE\\nThere’s never been a more important time to live our culture. The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing.\\nIn an economy where yesterday’s exceptional is today’s expected, all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and,\\nmore importantly, confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves. It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation,\\nbusiness models, and sales motions look like in this new era. As a high-performance organization, we aspire to help our employees\\nmaximize their economic opportunity, while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own\\npassion and purpose with their everyday work and the company’s mission.\\nTo be successful, we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need. W e need to innovate and collaborate as One\\nMicrosoft. And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where\\neveryone can do their best work. T o empower the world, we need to represent the world. T o that end, we remain focused on\\nincreasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion. Even as we navigated challenges this year, our company\\ncontinued to be the most globally diverse it’s ever been.\\nGiving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 105,000 employees gave $242 million (including company match) to over\\n35,000 nonprofits in 116 countries. And our employees volunteered over 930,000 hours to causes they care about.\\nI am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities, and how they are living our\\nmission and culture every day in a changing company and world.\\n**\\nIn closing, this is Microsoft’s moment. W e have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for\\nevery person and every organization on the planet.\\nOn New Y ear’s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, T esla’s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI, about how GitHub\\nCopilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy. T wo days later, I saw a stunning example  of work we’ve\\ndone with the government of India’s Ministry of Electronics and IT, which is applying an AI model so farmers in rural areas can interact\\nwith government resources in their native languages.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 6/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='$ $ $\\n$ $ $Think about that: A foundation model that was developed on the W est Coast of the United S tates is already transforming the lives of\\nboth elite developers and rural farmers on the other side of the globe.

In this year’s report, we again expanded our pay equity data\\nbeyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce.\\nIn addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees\\nregardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay\\nfor women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the\\nU.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees.

W e are creating the platforms and tools,\\npowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business\\ncompetitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.\\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses;\\nlicensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and\\nselling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based\\nservices, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and\\nincome taxes.\\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0\\nmillion.\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue decreased 25%.\\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\\nIndustr y TrendsAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 21/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift\\nis an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business.\\nAt Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to\\nidentify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form\\nfactors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of\\nwhich suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global\\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. W e must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in\\npace with this changing environment.\\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may\\ndecrease our operating margins. W e continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase\\nour server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our\\ndatacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers,\\nincluding graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract\\nmanufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes\\nunavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very\\nfew qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet\\nconsumer demand.\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. W e hire a mix of university and industry\\ntalent worldwide. W e compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer\\nreach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive\\ncompensation and benefits.\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue\\nand expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our\\ninternational operations in fiscal year 2023.\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize\\nour investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of\\nfiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from\\nchanges to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by\\napproximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our\\ntotal employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating\\nboth our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are\\nconsolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder\\nof fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\nRefer to Risk F actors in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\nSeasonality\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue\\nis driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter\\nrevenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\nChange in Accounting Estimat e\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software\\nthat increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined\\nwe should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in\\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment\\nincluded in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase\\nin operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\\nRepor table Segments\\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and\\nMore P ersonal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal\\nmanagement reporting.

The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily\\ndue to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and a\\ndecrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.\\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U.S. The\\ntransfer of intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of\\nfuture U.S. tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability from the U.S. global intangible low-taxed income tax.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 27/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $\\n$ $Our effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate, primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign\\njurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in\\nIreland.\\nThe mix of income before income taxes between the U.S. and foreign countries impacted our effective tax rate as a result of the\\ngeographic distribution of, and customer demand for, our products and services. In fiscal year 2023, our U.S. income before income\\ntaxes was $52.9 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $36.4 billion. In fiscal year 2022, our U.S. income before\\nincome taxes was $47.8 billion and our foreign income before income taxes was $35.9 billion.\\nUncer tain T ax Positions\\nWe settled a portion of the Internal R evenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the\\nIRS withdrew its 2011 R evenue Agents R eport related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of\\nthe examination. W e also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit\\nfor tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS\\naudits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. W e remain under audit for tax years\\n2004 to 2017.\\nAs of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in\\nour consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. W e believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are\\nadequate. W e have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. W e do not expect a final\\nresolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant\\nincrease or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to\\nexamination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of\\nthese audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP\\nfinancial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting\\nfrom changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures\\nexclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. W e believe these\\nnon-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting\\nour business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results\\nin evaluating business performance.

Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term\\ninvestments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid\\ninvestment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S.\\ndollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income\\ninvestments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are\\nmanaged to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments\\nis insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\\nValuation\\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of\\nour financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common\\nand preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to\\ndetermine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are\\nobservable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper,\\ncertificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\\nbonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets\\nand liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either\\nprovide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.\\nBroker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a\\nbroker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally\\nclassified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant\\nadjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair\\nvalues used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate\\nfair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period\\nfluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\\nCash Flows\\nCash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees\\nand suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in\\nfinancing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock\\nrepurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in\\ninvesting decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of\\ncompanies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from\\nnet investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\\nDebt Pr oceeds\\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest\\nrate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among\\nother things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing\\ndebt.

W e have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities\\nor other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\\nCRITICAL A CCOUNTING ESTIMA TES\\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated\\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and\\ncould have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. W e have critical accounting estimates in the areas of\\nrevenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies,\\nincome taxes, and inventories.\\nRevenue R ecognition\\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether\\nproducts and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may\\nrequire significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment\\nis required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and\\naccounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a\\nsignificant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. R evenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\\ncloud services are provided.\\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. W e use a single\\namount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\\nprovided at no additional charge. W e use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services\\nseparately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and\\nservices.\\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. W e typically have more than one SSP for\\nindividual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these\\ninstances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including\\nthe exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of\\nrevenue to recognize. R eturns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if\\nadditional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods\\npresented.\\nImpairment o f Inv estment Secur ities\\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate,\\namong other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less\\nthan cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that\\nconsiders available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we\\nconsider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell\\nthe security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below\\ncost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If\\nmarket, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. W e perform a qualitative assessment on a\\nperiodic basis. W e are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an\\ninvestment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. W e evaluate\\nour reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis\\n(May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of\\na reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate,\\nlegal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets\\nand liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis\\nrequires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of theAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 31/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our\\nweighted average cost of capital.\\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market\\nconditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and\\ngoodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\\nResear ch and Dev elopment Costs\\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological\\nfeasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the\\nproduct is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product\\nis established. W e have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development\\nissues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.\\nThe amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss\\ncontingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a\\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued\\nwe evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate\\nof the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nIncome T axes\\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and\\ndeferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial\\nstatements or tax returns. W e recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax\\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\\nrecognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax\\nassets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with\\ntax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been\\nrecognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. V ariations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences\\ncould materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and\\nmanufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less\\nestimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. W e regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase\\ncommitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts,\\nproduct life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review\\nindicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\\nSTATEMENT OF MANA GEMENT ’S RESPONSIBILIT Y FOR FINANCIAL ST ATEMENTS\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in\\nthis report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have\\nbeen prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United S tates of America.\\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that\\nassets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing\\nconsolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets.

Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due\\nto risks and uncertainties.\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software\\nthat increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined\\nwe should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in\\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment\\nincluded in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase\\nin operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\\nForeign Curr encies\\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. R evenue and\\nexpenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. T ranslation adjustments resulting from this process\\nare recorded to other comprehensive income.\\nRevenue\\nProduct R evenue and Ser vice and Other R evenue\\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications,\\nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such\\nas PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and\\ncontent such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also\\nincludes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\\nRevenue R ecognition\\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. W e enter into contracts that can include various\\ncombinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance\\nobligations. R evenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently\\nremitted to governmental authorities.\\nNature of Products and Services\\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the\\ncustomer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality\\nand differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. R evenue from distinct on-premises licenses is\\nrecognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to\\nsoftware updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are\\nprovided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance\\n(“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to\\nhelp customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when\\nsold with SA. R evenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume\\nand receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are\\nprovided on either a subscription or consumption basis. R evenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is\\nrecognized ratably over the contract period. R evenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount\\nof storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a\\nsignificant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all\\nrevenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to\\nearn the revenue has been completed. R evenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without\\nthe operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and\\nrevenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores\\nand online marketplaces.\\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and\\nservice offering.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 38/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='$ $ $\\n$ $ $Significant Judgments\\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether\\nproducts and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may\\nrequire significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment\\nis required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and\\naccounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a\\nsignificant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. R evenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\\ncloud services are provided.\\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. W e use a single amount to estimate SSP for\\nitems that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.\\nWe use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine\\nwhether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. W e typically have more than one SSP for\\nindividual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these\\ninstances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including\\nthe exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of\\nrevenue to recognize. R eturns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if\\nadditional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods\\npresented.\\nContract Balances and Other R eceiv ables\\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. W e record a receivable when revenue is\\nrecognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements,\\nwe generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. W e record a receivable related to revenue\\nrecognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related\\nto those licenses.\\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud\\nservices. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and\\nrecognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the\\nfuture, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business\\nsolutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product\\nor service.\\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned R evenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned\\nrevenue during the period.\\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally\\ndo not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified\\nand predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers\\nwith financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract\\nperiod, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion,\\nrespectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.

W e record an allowance to cover expected losses based on\\ntroubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\\nAssets R ecognized fr om Costs t o Obtain a Contract with a Cust omer\\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be\\nlonger than one year. W e have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. T otal\\ncapitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term\\nassets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization\\nperiod would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain\\npartner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\\nCost o f Revenue\\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to\\nproduct support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original\\nequipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support\\nand maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory\\nvaluation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software\\ndevelopment costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\\nProduct W arranty\\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related\\nrevenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates,\\nhistorical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and\\nconditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over\\na period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as\\nsecurity patches, over the estimated life of the software. W e regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded\\nwarranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\\nResear ch and Dev elopment\\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-\\nrelated expenses associated with product development. R esearch and development expenses also include third-party development\\nand programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software\\ndevelopment are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our\\nsoftware products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such\\ncosts are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\\nSales and Mark eting\\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related\\nexpenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other\\nprograms. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal\\nyears 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured\\nat the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance\\nperiod.

Certain\\nincome and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary\\ndifferences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely\\nthan not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\nFinancial Instr uments\\nInvestments\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\\nequivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of\\ngreater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with\\nmaturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable\\nsecurities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification\\nmethod. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. F air value is\\ncalculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment\\nexceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the\\nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. T o determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers\\navailable quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of,\\nand business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell\\nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense),\\nnet and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur\\nfuture impairments.\\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable\\nfair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or\\nimpairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). W e perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an\\nimpairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are\\nrecorded in other income (expense), net.\\nDerivatives\\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with\\noffsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of\\neffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other\\ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and\\nlosses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in\\nother income (expense), net.\\nFair V alue Measur ements\\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to\\nwhich inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. W e categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of\\nthese three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\\ninclude U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilitiesAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 41/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='include those actively traded on exchanges.\\nLevel 2  – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\\nthe assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\\nvalue using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and\\nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign\\ngovernment bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2\\nderivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\\nLevel 3  – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants\\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option\\npricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and\\nbonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.\\nUnobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments\\nare determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market\\ncomparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and\\nmanufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less\\nestimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. W e regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase\\ncommitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying\\nvalue, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\\nProper ty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the\\nshorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are\\ngenerally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years;\\nbuildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10\\nyears. Land is not depreciated.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“R OU”) assets,\\nother current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\\nequipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\\nlease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease R OU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the\\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our\\nincremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease\\npayments at commencement date. The operating lease R OU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease\\nincentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise\\nthat option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain\\nequipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for\\ncertain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease R OU assets and liabilities.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an\\nannual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the\\nfair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\\nIntangible Assets\\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of\\nbenefit, ranging from one to 20 years. W e evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or\\ncircumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during\\nthe period.

W e assumed responsibility for these\\nclaims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine\\nof these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate\\n2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular\\nhandsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FC C Guidelines”)\\nare pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FC C Guidelines or were\\nmanufactured before the FC C Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the\\nscience and testing around emission guidelines.\\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis\\nof flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the\\nplaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\\nchallenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting\\nthe standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard.\\nThe plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation\\ntook place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts\\nthat cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying.\\nIrish Data Pr otection Commission Matt er\\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s\\ntargeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection R egulation (“GDPR”).\\nMicrosoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry.

As a company, we believe we can be the democratizing force for this new generation of technology and the opportunity it\\nwill help unlock for every country, community, and individual, while mitigating its risks.\\nHere are just a few examples of how we are already doing this:\\nLeading electronic health records vendor Epic is addressing some of the biggest challenges facing the healthcare industry today—\\nincluding physician burnout—by deploying a wide range of copilot solutions built on Azure OpenAI Service and Dragon Ambient\\neXperience Copilot.\\nMercado Libre  is reducing the time its developers spend writing code by more than 50 percent with GitHub Copilot, as the\\ncompany works to democratize e-commerce across Latin America.\\nMercedes-Benz  is making its in-car voice assistant more intuitive for hundreds of thousands of drivers using ChatGPT via the Azure\\nOpenAI Service.\\nLumen T echnologies  is helping its employees be more productive, enabling them to focus on higher value-added activities, by\\ndeploying Microsoft 365 Copilot.\\nNonprofit The Contingent  is matching foster families with children in need using Dynamics 365, P ower BI, and Azure, with an eye\\non using AI to amplify its work across the US.\\nAnd, Taiwan’s Ministry of Education  has built an online platform to help elementary and high school students learn English using\\nAzure AI.\\nTo build on this progress, we remain convicted on three things: First, we will maintain our lead as the top commercial cloud while\\ninnovating in consumer categories, from gaming to professional social networks. Second, because we know that maximum enterprise\\nvalue gets created during platform shifts like this one, we will invest to accelerate our lead in AI by infusing this technology across\\nevery layer of the tech stack. And, finally, we will continue to drive operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue\\ngrowth.\\nAs we make progress on these priorities, we delivered strong results in fiscal year 2023, including a record $211 billion in revenue and\\nover $88 billion in operating income.\\nA NE W ERA OF AI\\nThere are two breakthroughs coming together to define this new era of AI. The first is the most universal interface: natural language.\\nThe long arc of computing has, in many ways, been shaped by the pursuit of increasingly intuitive human-computer interfaces—\\nkeyboards, mice, touch screens. W e believe we have now arrived at the next big step forward—natural language—and will quickly go\\nbeyond, to see, hear, interpret, and make sense of our intent and the world around us.\\nThe second is the emergence of a powerful new reasoning engine. For years, we’ve digitized daily life, places, and things and\\norganized them into databases. But in a world rich with data, what has been most scarce is our ability to reason over it. This\\ngeneration of AI helps us interact with data in powerful new ways—from completing or summarizing text, to detecting anomalies and\\nrecognizing images—to help us identify patterns and surface insights faster than ever.\\nTogether, these two breakthroughs will unlock massive new opportunity. And, in fact, just last month we announced our vision for\\nCopilot , an everyday AI companion. W e are building Copilot into all our most used products and experiences and allowing people to\\nsummon its power as a standalone app as well. Just like you boot up an OS to access applications or use a browser to visit websites\\ntoday, our belief is that you will invoke a Copilot to do all those activities and more: to shop, to code, to analyze, to learn, to create.\\nAs a company, any time we approach a transition like this, we do so responsibly. W e believe AI should be as empowering across\\ncommunities as it is powerful, and we’re committed to ensuring it is responsibly built and designed, with safety in mind from the\\noutset.\\nOUR OPPOR TUNIT Y\\nEvery customer solution area and every layer of our tech stack will be reimagined for the AI era. And that’s exactly what we’ve already\\nbegun to do:Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 2/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Infrastr uctur e\\nFour years ago, we first invested  in our AI supercomputer, with a goal of building the best cloud for training and inference. T oday, it’s\\nbeing used by our partner OpenAI to power its best-in-class foundation models and services, including one of the fastest-growing\\nconsumer apps ever—ChatGPT. NVIDIA, as well as leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection, is also using our infrastructure to\\nbuild its own breakthrough models.\\nMore broadly, organizations continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric—from cloud to edge—to run their mission-critical\\napplications. W e continued to see more cloud migrations to Azure this past fiscal year, as it remains early when it comes to the long-\\nterm cloud opportunity. And we also continue to lead in hybrid computing with Azure Arc, which now has 18,000 customers.\\nData and AI\\nEvery AI app starts with data, and having a comprehensive data and analytics platform is more important than ever. Our Intelligent\\nData Platform brings together operational databases, analytics, and governance so organizations can spend more time creating value\\nand less time integrating their data estate. W e also introduced Microsoft F abric  this year, which unifies compute, storage, and\\ngovernance with a disruptive business model.\\nWith Azure AI, we are making foundation models available as platforms to our customers. W e offer the best selection of industry-\\nleading frontier and open models. In January, we made the Azure OpenAI Service  broadly available, bringing together advanced\\nmodels, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. More than 11,000 organizations across industries are\\nalready using it for advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Meta chose us  this summer as its preferred cloud to\\ncommercialize its Llama family of models. And, with Azure AI S tudio , we provide a full lifecycle toolchain customers can use to ground\\nthese models on their own data, create prompt workflows, and help ensure they are deployed and used safely.\\nDigital and app innov ation\\nGitHub Copilot  is fundamentally transforming developer productivity, helping developers complete coding tasks 55 percent faster.\\nMore than 27,000 organizations have chosen GitHub Copilot for Business, and to date more than 1 million people have used GitHub\\nCopilot to code faster. W e also announced our vision for the future of software development with GitHub Copilot X , which will bring\\nthe power of AI throughout the entire software development lifecycle. All up, GitHub surpassed $1 billion in annual recurring revenue\\nfor the first time this fiscal year.\\nWe’re also applying AI across our low-code/no-code toolchain to help domain experts across an organization automate workflows,\\ncreate apps and webpages, build virtual agents, or analyze data, using just natural language with copilots in P ower Platform . More\\nthan 63,000 organizations have used AI-powered capabilities in P ower Platform to date.\\nBusiness applications\\nWe are bringing the next generation of AI to employees across every job function and every line of business with Dynamics 365\\nCopilot , which works across CRM and ERP systems to reduce burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and\\nnotetaking. In fact, our own support agents  are using Copilot in Dynamics 365 Customer Service to resolve more cases faster and\\nwithout having to call on peers to help. With our Supply Chain Platform , we’re helping customers apply AI to predict and mitigate\\ndisruptions. And, with our new Microsoft Sales Copilot , sellers can infuse their customer interactions with data from CRM systems—\\nincluding both  Salesforce and Dynamics—to close more deals.\\nAll up, Dynamics surpassed $5 billion in revenue over the past fiscal year, with our customer experience, service, and finance and\\nsupply chain businesses each surpassing $1 billion in annual sales.\\nIndustr y\\nAcross industries, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any organization looking to generate real value from AI. In\\nhealthcare, for example, we introduced the world’s first fully automated clinical documentation application, DAX Copilot . The\\napplication helps physicians reduce documentation time by half, freeing them to spend more time face to face with patients. And Epic\\nwill integrate it  directly into its electronic health records system.\\nAnd, in retail, we introduced new tools  to help companies manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores.\\nModer n work\\nWe are rapidly evolving Microsoft 365 into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and\\nproductivity, with both our established applications like Office and T eams, as well as new apps like Designer, S tream, and Loop.\\nMicrosoft 365 is designed for today’s digitally connected, distributed workforce.\\nThis year, we also introduced a new pillar of customer value with Microsoft 365 Copilot , which combines next-generation AI with\\nbusiness data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications to help people be more productive and unleash their creativity at\\nwork. Just last month, I was excited to announce that we will make Microsoft 365 Copilot generally available to our commercial\\ncustomers later this year.\\nWe continue to build momentum in Microsoft T eams across collaboration, chat, meetings, and calls. W e introduced a new version of\\nTeams  that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50 percent less memory. W e also introduced Teams Premium  to\\nmeet enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent meeting recaps. All up, T eams usage surpassed 300 million monthly\\nactive users this year.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 3/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='With Microsoft Viva, we have created a new category for employee experience. Copilot in Viva  offers leaders a new way to build high-\\nperformance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. This year, Viva surpassed 35 million monthly active\\nusers.\\nSecur ity\\nAs the rate and pace of cyberthreats continue to accelerate, security is a top priority for every organization. Our comprehensive, AI-\\npowered solutions give defenders the advantage. With Security Copilot , we’re combining large language models with a domain-\\nspecific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of security\\noperations center productivity.\\nAll up, more than 1 million organizations now count on our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions to protect their digital estates, and\\nour security business surpassed $20 billion in annual revenue, as we help protect customers across clouds and endpoint platforms.\\xa0\\nSearch, adv ertising, and news\\nWe are reshaping daily search and web habits with our new Bing and Microsoft Edge browser , which brings together search,\\nbrowsing, chat, and AI into one unified experience to deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat experience, and the\\nability to generate content. W e think of these tools as an AI copilot for the web.\\nWe are also bringing these breakthrough capabilities to businesses, with Bing Chat Enterprise , which offers commercial data\\nprotection, providing an easy on-ramp for any organization looking to get the benefit of next-generation AI today.\\nAlthough it’s early in our journey, Bing users engaged in more than 1 billion chats and created more than 750 million images over the\\npast year as they apply these new tools to get things done. And Edge has taken share for nine consecutive quarters.\\nMore broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. This year, Netflix chose us  as its exclusive technology and sales\\npartner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for\\na flexible partner to build and innovate with them.\\nLinkedIn\\nThe excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function—from marketing, sales, service, and finance, to software\\ndevelopment and security. And LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills. W e are using\\nAI to help our members and customers connect to opportunities and tap into the experiences of experts on the platform. In fact, our\\nAI-powered articles are already the fastest-growing traffic driver to the network.\\nAll up, LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $15 billion for the first time this fiscal year, a testament to how mission critical the platform has\\nbecome to help more than 950 million members connect, learn, sell, and get hired.\\nGaming\\nIn gaming, we are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, wherever, and\\nhowever they want. With Xbox Game P ass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. Content is the flywheel\\nbehind the service’s growth, and our pipeline has never been stronger. It was especially energizing to release Starfield  this fall to\\nbroad acclaim, with more than 10 million players in the first month post-launch alone.\\nEarlier this month, we were thrilled to close our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming\\nmonths about how, together , we will bring the joy of gaming to more people around the world.\\nDevices and cr eativity\\nFinally, we’re turning Windows into a powerful new AI canvas with Copilot , which rolled out as part of a Windows 11 update last\\nmonth. It uniquely incorporates the context and intelligence of the web, your work data, and what you are doing in the moment on\\nyour PC to provide better assistance, while keeping your privacy and security at the forefront. Overall, the number of devices running\\nWindows 11 more than doubled in the past year. And we are also transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with\\nAzure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365, which together surpassed $1 billion in annual revenue for the first time.\\nOUR RESPONSIBILIT Y\\nAs we pursue our opportunity, we are also working to ensure technology helps us solve problems—not create new ones. T o do this,\\nwe focus on four enduring commitments that are central to our mission and that take on even greater importance in this new era. For\\nus, these commitments are more than just words. They’re a guide to help us make decisions across everything we do—as we design\\nand develop products, shape business processes and policies, help our customers thrive, build partnerships, and more —always\\nasking ourselves critical questions to ensure our actions are aligned with them.\\nHow can w e exp and oppor tunity ?\\nFirst, we believe access to economic growth and opportunity should reach every person, organization, community, and country. And\\nalthough AI can serve as a catalyst for opportunity and growth, we must first ensure everyone has access to the technologies, data,\\nand skills they need to benefit.\\nTo achieve this, we are focused on getting technology into the hands of nonprofits, social entrepreneurs, and other civil society\\norganizations to help them digitally transform, so they can help address some of society’s biggest challenges. This year, we providedAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 4/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='nonprofits  with over $3.8 billion in discounted and donated technology. Nearly 325,000 nonprofits used our cloud. And to help them\\ntap the potential of AI, we’re building new AI capabilities for fundraising, marketing, and program delivery.\\nAI will displace some jobs, but it will also create new ones. That’s why we aim to train and certify 10 million people by 2025 with the\\nskills for jobs  and livelihoods in an increasingly digital economy. Since July 2020, we’ve helped 8.5 million people, including 2.7 million\\nthis year. W e’ve also focused on skilling women and underrepresented communities in cybersecurity, working across 28 countries and\\nwith nearly 400 US community colleges to scale our efforts.\\nFinally, to help people learn more about AI, we launched the first online Professional Certificate on Generative AI  in partnership with\\nLinkedIn Learning, created AI tools for educators, and held our first AI Community Learning event in the US. These events will be\\nreplicated around the world and localized in 10 languages over the next year. W e also partnered to launch a Generative AI Skills Grant\\nChallenge  to explore how nonprofit, social enterprise, and research or academic institutions can empower the workforce to use this\\nnew generation of AI.\\nHow can w e ear n trust?\\nTo create positive impact with technology, people need to be able to trust the technologies they use and the companies behind them.\\nFor us, earning trust spans the responsible use of AI, protecting privacy, and advancing digital safety and cybersecurity.\\xa0\\nOur commitment to responsible AI is not new. Since 2017, we’ve worked to develop our responsible AI practice, recognizing that trust\\nis never given but earned through action.\\nWe have translated our AI principles  into a core set of implementation processes, as well as tools, training, and practices to support\\ncompliance. But internal programs aren’t enough. W e also enable our customers and partners to develop and deploy AI safely,\\nincluding through our AI customer commitments  and services like Azure AI S tudio, with its content safety tooling and access to our\\nResponsible AI dashboard.\\nBuilding AI responsibly requires that we work with other industry leaders, civil society, and governments to advocate for AI regulations\\nand governance globally. This year, we released our Governing AI Blueprint , which outlines concrete legal and policy\\nrecommendations for AI guardrails. W e are signatories to the eight voluntary commitments  developed with the US White House, and\\nproud of the six additional commitments we’ve made to further strengthen and operationalize the principles of safety, security, and\\ntrust.\\nThe era of AI heightens the importance of cybersecurity, and we deepened our work across the private and public sectors to improve\\ncyber-resilience. W e’ve continued to support Ukraine in defending critical infrastructure, detecting and disrupting cyberattacks and\\ncyberinfluence operations, and providing intelligence related to these attacks. Our Microsoft Threat Analysis Center team produced\\nmore than 500 intelligence reports to help keep customers and the public informed. And we published our third annual Microsoft\\nDigital Defense R eport , sharing our learnings and security recommendations.\\nWe also remain committed to creating safe experiences online and protecting customers from illegal and harmful content and\\nconduct, while respecting human rights. W e supported the Christchurch Call Initiative on Algorithmic Outcomes to address terrorist\\nand violent and extremist content online. And through the W orld Economic Forum’s Global Coalition for Digital Safety, we co-led the\\ndevelopment of new global principles for digital safety.\\nProtecting customers’ privacy and giving them control of their data is more important than ever. W e’ve begun our phased rollout of\\nthe EU Data Boundary , supporting our commercial and public sector customers’ need for data sovereignty. And each month, more\\nthan 3 million people exercise their data protection rights through our privacy dashboard, making meaningful choices about how\\ntheir data is used.\\nHow can w e protect fundamental r ights?\\nIn an increasingly digital world, we have a responsibility to promote and protect people’s fundamental rights and address the\\nchallenges technology creates. For us, this means upholding responsible business practices, expanding connectivity and accessibility,\\nadvancing fair and inclusive societies, and empowering communities.\\nIn 2023, we worked diligently to anticipate harmful uses of our technology and put guardrails on the use of technologies that are\\nconsequential to people’s lives or legal status, create risk of harm, or threaten human rights. W e will continue to assess the impact of\\nour technologies, engage our stakeholders, and model and adopt responsible practices and respect for human rights—including\\nacross our global supply chain.\\nToday, our lives are more connected than ever. Access to education, employment, healthcare, and other critical services is increasingly\\ndependent on technology. That’s why we’ve expanded our commitment to bring access to affordable high-speed internet  to a quarter\\nof a billion people around the world, including 100 million people in Africa, by the end of 2025. Since 2017, we’ve helped bring\\ninternet access to 63 million people, a key first step to ensuring communities will have access to AI and other digital technologies.\\nThis year, we also continued working toward our five-year commitment to bridge the disability divide with a focus on helping close\\nthe accessibility knowledge gap. Seven hundred and fifty-thousand learners enriched their understanding of disability and\\naccessibility in partnership with LinkedIn Learning , Teach Access , and the Microsoft disability community.\\nIn addition, we’re stepping up efforts to combat online disinformation through new media content provenance technologies—\\nenabling users to verify if an image or video was generated by AI. W e continued our efforts to promote racial equity  across Microsoft,\\nour ecosystem, and our communities, including our work to advance justice reform through data-driven insights. And we provided\\nsupport in response to eight humanitarian disasters, including committing $540 million of support to those who have been impacted\\nby the W ar in Ukraine.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 5/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Finally, recognizing AI’s potential to advance human rights and humanitarian action, we worked on several AI for Humanitarian Action\\nprojects. T ogether with our partners, we’re building the capabilities to identify at-risk communities , estimate seasonal hunger, predict\\nmalnutrition, and assist in disease identification.\\nHow can w e adv ance sustainability ?\\nClimate change is the defining issue of our generation, and addressing it requires swift, collective action and technological innovation.\\nWe are committed to meeting our own goals while enabling others to do the same. That means taking responsibility for our\\noperational footprint and accelerating progress through technology.\\nWe continue to see extreme weather impacting communities globally. T o meet the urgent need, this must be a decade of innovation\\nand decisive action—for Microsoft, our customers, and the world.\\nIn our latest Environmental Sustainability R eport , we shared our progress toward our 2030 sustainability targets across carbon, water,\\nwaste, and ecosystems. In 2022, our overall carbon emissions declined by 0.5 percent while our business grew. Addressing scope 3\\nemissions, which account for the vast majority of our emissions, is arguably our ultimate challenge—one we’ll continue to tackle\\nthrough our supply chain, policy advances, and industry-wide knowledge-sharing.\\nWe’ve provided just under 1 million people with access to clean water and sanitation, one of five pillars  on our path to becoming\\nwater positive. And in our pursuit to be zero waste, we achieved a reuse and recycle rate of 82 percent for all our cloud hardware and\\ndiverted over 12,000 metric tons of solid operational waste from landfills and incinerators.\\nWe also continue to take responsibility for the impacts of our direct operations on Earth’s ecosystems. W e’ve contracted to protect\\n17,268 acres of land, over 50 percent more than the land we use to operate. Of that, 12,270 acres—the equivalent of approximately\\n7,000 soccer fields—were designated as permanently protected.\\nTechnology is a powerful lever to help us avoid the most severe impacts of climate change. That’s why we’re accelerating our\\ninvestment in more efficient datacenters, clean energy, enhancements to the Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability  and Planetary\\nComputer, and green software practices. T o date, through our Climate Innovation Fund , we’ve allocated more than $700 million to a\\nglobal portfolio of 50+ investments spanning sustainable solutions in energy, industrial, and natural systems.\\nFinally, we believe AI can be a powerful accelerant in addressing the climate crisis. W e expanded our AI for Good Lab  in Egypt and\\nKenya to improve climate resilience for the continent. And, together with our partners, we launched Global R enewables W atch, a first-\\nof-its-kind living atlas that aims to map and measure utility-scale solar and wind installations, allowing users to evaluate progress\\ntoward a clean energy transition.\\nAlthough this new era promises great opportunity, it demands even greater responsibility from companies like ours. As we pursue our\\nfour commitments, we focus on transparency—providing clear reporting on how we run our business and how we work with\\ncustomers and partners. Our annual Impact Summary  shares more about our progress and learnings this year, and our Reports Hub\\nprovides detailed reports on our environmental data, political activities, workforce demographics, human rights work, and more.\\nOUR CUL TURE\\nThere’s never been a more important time to live our culture. The way we work and the speed at which we work are changing.\\nIn an economy where yesterday’s exceptional is today’s expected, all of us at Microsoft will need to embrace a growth mindset and,\\nmore importantly, confront our fixed mindsets as our culture evolves. It will take everyday courage to reformulate what innovation,\\nbusiness models, and sales motions look like in this new era. As a high-performance organization, we aspire to help our employees\\nmaximize their economic opportunity, while simultaneously helping them learn and grow professionally and connect their own\\npassion and purpose with their everyday work and the company’s mission.\\nTo be successful, we need to be grounded in what our customers and the world need. W e need to innovate and collaborate as One\\nMicrosoft. And we need to actively seek diversity and embrace inclusion to best serve our customers and create a culture where\\neveryone can do their best work. T o empower the world, we need to represent the world. T o that end, we remain focused on\\nincreasing representation and strengthening our culture of inclusion. Even as we navigated challenges this year, our company\\ncontinued to be the most globally diverse it’s ever been.\\nGiving also remains core to our culture. This year, more than 105,000 employees gave $242 million (including company match) to over\\n35,000 nonprofits in 116 countries. And our employees volunteered over 930,000 hours to causes they care about.\\nI am deeply grateful to our employees for their commitment to the company and their communities, and how they are living our\\nmission and culture every day in a changing company and world.\\n**\\nIn closing, this is Microsoft’s moment. W e have an incredible opportunity to use this new era of AI to deliver meaningful benefits for\\nevery person and every organization on the planet.\\nOn New Y ear’s Day, I saw a tweet from Andrej Karpathy, T esla’s former director of AI who now works at OpenAI, about how GitHub\\nCopilot was writing about 80 percent of his code, with 80 percent accuracy.

In this year’s report, we again expanded our pay equity data\\nbeyond the U.S. to report on 61 additional countries (up from 12 last year), representing 99.8% of our global Microsoft workforce.\\nIn addition, we began reporting on unadjusted median pay in our annual report, comparing total pay amounts for all employees\\nregardless of factors such as job title, level, or tenure. For employees who are eligible for rewards, the analysis showed that total pay\\nfor women is 89.6% of total pay for men in the U.S. and 86.2% outside of the U.S., and total pay for racial and ethnic minorities in the\\nU.S. is 89.9% of total pay for white employees. As we continue to increase representation for women and racial and ethnic minorities\\nat more senior levels, and continue to ensure pay equity for all, the gap between the medians will reduce.\\nOur intended result is a global performance and development approach that fosters our culture, and competitive compensation that\\nensures equitable pay by role while supporting pay for performance.\\nWellbeing and Hybr id W ork\\nMicrosoft is committed to supporting our employees’ wellbeing while they are at work and in their personal lives.

W e are creating the platforms and tools,\\npowered by artificial intelligence (“AI”), that deliver better, faster, and more effective solutions to support small and large business\\ncompetitiveness, improve educational and health outcomes, grow public-sector efficiency, and empower human ingenuity.\\nWe generate revenue by offering a wide range of cloud-based solutions, content, and other services to people and businesses;\\nlicensing and supporting an array of software products; delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience; and designing and\\nselling devices. Our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees; supporting and investing in our cloud-based\\nservices, including datacenter operations; designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling our other products and services; and\\nincome taxes.\\nHighlights from fiscal year 2023 compared with fiscal year 2022 included:\\nMicrosoft Cloud revenue increased 22% to $111.6 billion.\\nOffice Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 10% driven by Office 365 Commercial growth of 13%.\\nOffice Consumer products and cloud services revenue increased 2% and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers increased to 67.0\\nmillion.\\nLinkedIn revenue increased 10%.\\nDynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 16% driven by Dynamics 365 growth of 24%.\\nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 19% driven by Azure and other cloud services growth of 29%.\\nWindows original equipment manufacturer licensing (“Windows OEM”) revenue decreased 25%.\\nDevices revenue decreased 24%.\\nWindows Commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 5%.\\nXbox content and services revenue decreased 3%.\\nSearch and news advertising revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs increased 11%.\\nIndustr y TrendsAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 21/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Our industry is dynamic and highly competitive, with frequent changes in both technologies and business models. Each industry shift\\nis an opportunity to conceive new products, new technologies, or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business.\\nAt Microsoft, we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to\\nidentify and address the changing demands of customers and users, industry trends, and competitive forces.\\nEconomic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new\\nsoftware and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form\\nfactors customers prefer evolve rapidly, influencing how users access services in the cloud and, in some cases, the user’s choice of\\nwhich suite of cloud-based services to use. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is also correlated to global\\nmacroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic. W e must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in\\npace with this changing environment.\\nThe investments we are making in cloud and AI infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may\\ndecrease our operating margins. W e continue to identify and evaluate opportunities to expand our datacenter locations and increase\\nour server capacity to meet the evolving needs of our customers, particularly given the growing demand for AI services. Our\\ndatacenters depend on the availability of permitted and buildable land, predictable energy, networking supplies, and servers,\\nincluding graphics processing units (“GPUs”) and other components. Our devices are primarily manufactured by third-party contract\\nmanufacturers. For the majority of our products, we have the ability to use other manufacturers if a current vendor becomes\\nunavailable or unable to meet our requirements. However, some of our products contain certain components for which there are very\\nfew qualified suppliers. Extended disruptions at these suppliers could impact our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet\\nconsumer demand.\\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. W e hire a mix of university and industry\\ntalent worldwide. W e compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer\\nreach, scale in resources, the ability to grow one’s career across many different products and businesses, and competitive\\ncompensation and benefits.\\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are\\ndenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue\\nand expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies reduced reported revenue and expenses from our\\ninternational operations in fiscal year 2023.\\nOn January 18, 2023, we announced decisions we made to align our cost structure with our revenue and customer demand, prioritize\\nour investments in strategic areas, and consolidate office space. As a result, we recorded a $1.2 billion charge in the second quarter of\\nfiscal year 2023 (“Q2 charge”), which included employee severance expenses of $800 million, impairment charges resulting from\\nchanges to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. First, we reduced our overall workforce by\\napproximately 10,000 jobs through the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 related to the Q2 charge, which represents less than 5% of our\\ntotal employee base. While we eliminated roles in some areas, we will continue to hire in key strategic areas. Second, we are allocating\\nboth our capital and talent to areas of secular growth and long-term competitiveness, while divesting in other areas. Third, we are\\nconsolidating our leases to create higher density across our workspaces, which impacted our financial results through the remainder\\nof fiscal year 2023, and we may make similar decisions in future periods as we continue to evaluate our real estate needs.\\nRefer to Risk F actors in our fiscal year 2023 Form 10-K for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\\nSeasonality\\nOur revenue fluctuates quarterly and is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of our fiscal year. Second quarter revenue\\nis driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter\\nrevenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\\nChange in Accounting Estimat e\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software\\nthat increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined\\nwe should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in\\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment\\nincluded in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase\\nin operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\\nRepor table Segments\\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and\\nMore P ersonal Computing. The segment amounts included in MD&A are presented on a basis consistent with our internal\\nmanagement reporting.

W e also settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of the IRS audit\\nfor tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS\\naudits for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and interest. W e remain under audit for tax years\\n2004 to 2017.\\nAs of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in\\nour consolidated financial statements when the matters are resolved. W e believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are\\nadequate. W e have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. W e do not expect a final\\nresolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant\\nincrease or decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.\\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U.S. Our operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to\\nexamination for tax years 1996 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of each of\\nthese audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\\nAdjusted gross margin, operating income, net income, and diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Current year non-GAAP\\nfinancial measures exclude the impact of the Q2 charge, which includes employee severance expenses, impairment charges resulting\\nfrom changes to our hardware portfolio, and costs related to lease consolidation activities. Prior year non-GAAP financial measures\\nexclude the net income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. W e believe these\\nnon-GAAP measures aid investors by providing additional insight into our operational performance and help clarify trends affecting\\nour business. For comparability of reporting, management considers non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial results\\nin evaluating business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures presented should not be considered a substitute for, or\\nsuperior to, the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\\nThe following table reconciles our financial results reported in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP financial results:\\n(In millions, ex cept per centages and per shar e amounts) 2023 2022Percentage\\nChange\\nGross margin 146,052 135,620 8%\\nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 152 0 *\\nAdjusted gross margin (non-GAAP) 146,204 135,620 8%\\nOperating income 88,523 83,383 6%\\nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 1,171 0 *\\nAdjusted operating income (non-GAAP) 89,694 83,383 8%\\nNet income 72,361 72,738 (1)%\\nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 946 0 *\\nNet income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties 0 (3,291) *\\nAdjusted net income (non-GAAP) 73,307 69,447 6%\\nDiluted earnings per share 9.68 9.65 0%\\nSeverance, hardware-related impairment, and lease consolidation costs 0.13 0 *\\nNet income tax benefit related to transfer of intangible properties 0 (0.44) *\\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) 9.81 9.21 7%\\nLIQUIDIT Y AND CAPIT AL RESOUR CESNot meaningful.*Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 28/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='$We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets to\\ncontinue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as\\ndividends, share repurchases, debt maturities, material capital expenditures, and the transition tax related to the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act\\n(“TCJA”), for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nCash, Cash Equiv alents, and Inv estments\\nCash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $111.3 billion and $104.8 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022,\\nrespectively. Equity investments were $9.9 billion and $6.9 billion as of June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our short-term\\ninvestments are primarily intended to facilitate liquidity and capital preservation. They consist predominantly of highly liquid\\ninvestment-grade fixed-income securities, diversified among industries and individual issuers. The investments are predominantly U.S.\\ndollar-denominated securities, but also include foreign currency-denominated securities to diversify risk. Our fixed-income\\ninvestments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk. The credit risk and average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio are\\nmanaged to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed-income indices. The settlement risk related to these investments\\nis insignificant given that the short-term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment-grade fixed-income securities.\\nValuation\\nIn general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of\\nour financial instruments. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 1 investments, such as U.S. government securities, common\\nand preferred stock, and mutual funds. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to\\ndetermine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are\\nobservable either directly or indirectly. This pricing methodology applies to our Level 2 investments, such as commercial paper,\\ncertificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and\\nbonds, and municipal securities. Level 3 investments are valued using internally-developed models with unobservable inputs. Assets\\nand liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio.\\nA majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally Level 1 or Level 2 investments as these vendors either\\nprovide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments.\\nBroker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available, the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors, or when a\\nbroker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally\\nclassified as Level 2 investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant\\nadjustments. In addition, all our broker-priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair\\nvalues used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate\\nfair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review of key model inputs, analysis of period-over-period\\nfluctuations, and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate.\\nCash Flows\\nCash from operations decreased $1.5 billion to $87.6 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to an increase in cash paid to employees\\nand suppliers and cash used to pay income taxes, offset in part by an increase in cash received from customers. Cash used in\\nfinancing decreased $14.9 billion to $43.9 billion for fiscal year 2023, mainly due to a $10.5 billion decrease in common stock\\nrepurchases and a $6.3 billion decrease in repayments of debt, offset in part by a $1.7 billion increase in dividends paid. Cash used in\\ninvesting decreased $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion for fiscal year 2023, due to a $20.4 billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of\\ncompanies, net of cash acquired, and purchases of intangible and other assets, offset in part by a $8.2 billion decrease in cash from\\nnet investment purchases, sales, and maturities, and a $4.2 billion increase in additions to property and equipment.\\nDebt Pr oceeds\\nWe issue debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets, reflecting our credit rating and the low interest\\nrate environment. The proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among\\nother things, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repurchases of capital stock, acquisitions, and repayment of existing\\ndebt.

W e have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities\\nor other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources.\\nCRITICAL A CCOUNTING ESTIMA TES\\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated\\nfinancial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,\\nrevenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and\\ncould have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. W e have critical accounting estimates in the areas of\\nrevenue recognition, impairment of investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies,\\nincome taxes, and inventories.\\nRevenue R ecognition\\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether\\nproducts and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may\\nrequire significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment\\nis required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and\\naccounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a\\nsignificant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. R evenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\\ncloud services are provided.\\nJudgment is required to determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation. W e use a single\\namount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates\\nprovided at no additional charge. W e use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services\\nseparately and need to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and\\nservices.\\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. W e typically have more than one SSP for\\nindividual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these\\ninstances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including\\nthe exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of\\nrevenue to recognize. R eturns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if\\nadditional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods\\npresented.\\nImpairment o f Inv estment Secur ities\\nWe review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate,\\namong other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less\\nthan cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, we employ a systematic methodology that\\nconsiders available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments. In addition, we\\nconsider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell\\nthe security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below\\ncost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If\\nmarket, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.\\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down to fair value if a qualitative assessment indicates that the\\ninvestment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. W e perform a qualitative assessment on a\\nperiodic basis. W e are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss. Once an\\ninvestment is determined to be impaired, an impairment charge is recorded in other income (expense), net.\\nGoodwill\\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. W e evaluate\\nour reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill is\\ntested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis\\n(May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of\\na reporting unit below its carrying value. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate,\\nlegal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit.\\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets\\nand liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit.\\nThe fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis\\nrequires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of theAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 31/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our\\nweighted average cost of capital.\\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market\\nconditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and\\ngoodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\\nResear ch and Dev elopment Costs\\nCosts incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological\\nfeasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility is established, software costs are capitalized until the\\nproduct is available for general release to customers. Judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product\\nis established. W e have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high-risk development\\nissues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released to production.\\nThe amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products.\\nLegal and Other Contingencies\\nThe outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss\\ncontingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a\\nliability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued\\nwe evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate\\nof the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nIncome T axes\\nThe objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and\\ndeferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity’s financial\\nstatements or tax returns. W e recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax\\nposition will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\\nrecognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50%\\nlikelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax\\nassets and liabilities, classification of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with\\ntax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been\\nrecognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. V ariations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences\\ncould materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and\\nmanufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less\\nestimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. W e regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase\\ncommitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. These reviews include analysis of demand forecasts,\\nproduct life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. If our review\\nindicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\\nSTATEMENT OF MANA GEMENT ’S RESPONSIBILIT Y FOR FINANCIAL ST ATEMENTS\\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in\\nthis report. The consolidated financial statements, which include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments, have\\nbeen prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United S tates of America.\\nThe Company designs and maintains accounting and internal control systems to provide reasonable assurance at reasonable cost that\\nassets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, and that the financial records are reliable for preparing\\nconsolidated financial statements and maintaining accountability for assets.

Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and assumptions due\\nto risks and uncertainties.\\nIn July 2022, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our server and network equipment. Due to investments in software\\nthat increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, we determined\\nwe should increase the estimated useful lives of both server and network equipment from four years to six years. This change in\\naccounting estimate was effective beginning fiscal year 2023. Based on the carrying amount of server and network equipment\\nincluded in property and equipment, net as of June 30, 2022, the effect of this change in estimate for fiscal year 2023 was an increase\\nin operating income of $3.7 billion and net income of $3.0 billion, or $0.40 per both basic and diluted share.\\nForeign Curr encies\\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. R evenue and\\nexpenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. T ranslation adjustments resulting from this process\\nare recorded to other comprehensive income.\\nRevenue\\nProduct R evenue and Ser vice and Other R evenue\\nProduct revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity and collaboration applications, server applications,\\nbusiness solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such\\nas PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\\nService and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and\\ncontent such as Office 365, Azure, Dynamics 365, and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also\\nincludes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn.\\nRevenue R ecognition\\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the\\nconsideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services. W e enter into contracts that can include various\\ncombinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance\\nobligations. R evenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently\\nremitted to governmental authorities.\\nNature of Products and Services\\nLicenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available to the\\ncustomer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality\\nand differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. R evenue from distinct on-premises licenses is\\nrecognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to\\nsoftware updates, primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is recognized as the updates are\\nprovided, which is generally ratably over the estimated life of the related device or license.\\nCertain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance\\n(“SA”). SA conveys rights to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training to\\nhelp customers deploy and use products more efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when\\nsold with SA. R evenue allocated to SA is generally recognized ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume\\nand receive benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time.\\nCloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are\\nprovided on either a subscription or consumption basis. R evenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is\\nrecognized ratably over the contract period. R evenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount\\nof storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of such resources. When cloud services require a\\nsignificant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all\\nrevenue is recognized over the period in which the cloud services are provided.\\nRevenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in the search results or when the action necessary to\\nearn the revenue has been completed. R evenue from consulting services is recognized as services are provided.\\nOur hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without\\nthe operating system. In these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single performance obligation and\\nrevenue is recognized at the point in time when ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through retail stores\\nand online marketplaces.\\nRefer to Note 19 – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue by significant product and\\nservice offering.Annual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 38/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 38}, page_content='$ $ $\\n$ $ $Significant Judgments\\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether\\nproducts and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may\\nrequire significant judgment. When a cloud-based service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment\\nis required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and\\naccounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office 365, depend on a\\nsignificant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are\\naccounted for together as one performance obligation. R evenue from Office 365 is recognized ratably over the period in which the\\ncloud services are provided.\\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. W e use a single amount to estimate SSP for\\nitems that are not sold separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates provided at no additional charge.\\nWe use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine\\nwhether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.\\nIn instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the SSP\\nusing information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. W e typically have more than one SSP for\\nindividual products and services due to the stratification of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these\\ninstances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and geographic region in determining the SSP.\\nDue to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is required to assess the pattern of delivery, including\\nthe exercise pattern of certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.\\nOur products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate\\ncustomer usage of our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration when determining the amount of\\nrevenue to recognize. R eturns and credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if\\nadditional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods\\npresented.\\nContract Balances and Other R eceiv ables\\nTiming of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. W e record a receivable when revenue is\\nrecognized prior to invoicing, or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For multi-year agreements,\\nwe generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual coverage period. W e record a receivable related to revenue\\nrecognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment in the future related\\nto those licenses.\\nUnearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing programs, which may include SA and cloud\\nservices. Unearned revenue is generally invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year agreements and\\nrecognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the\\nfuture, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business\\nsolutions, and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product\\nor service.\\nRefer to Note 13 – Unearned R evenue for further information, including unearned revenue by segment and changes in unearned\\nrevenue during the period.\\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally\\ndo not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified\\nand predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers\\nwith financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract\\nperiod, and multi-year on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.\\nAs of June 30, 2023 and 2022, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $4.5 billion and $3.8 billion,\\nrespectively, and is included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance.

W e record an allowance to cover expected losses based on\\ntroubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.\\nAssets R ecognized fr om Costs t o Obtain a Contract with a Cust omer\\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be\\nlonger than one year. W e have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. T otal\\ncapitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term\\nassets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization\\nperiod would have been one year or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation program and certain\\npartner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.\\nCost o f Revenue\\nCost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to\\nproduct support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on PCs sold by original\\nequipment manufacturers (“OEM”), to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support\\nand maintain cloud-based and other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory\\nvaluation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software\\ndevelopment costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.\\nProduct W arranty\\nWe provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties at the time the related\\nrevenue is recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates,\\nhistorical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and\\nconditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but generally include parts and labor over\\na period generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as\\nsecurity patches, over the estimated life of the software. W e regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded\\nwarranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.\\nResear ch and Dev elopment\\nResearch and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-\\nrelated expenses associated with product development. R esearch and development expenses also include third-party development\\nand programming costs and the amortization of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software\\ndevelopment are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our\\nsoftware products, is generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such\\ncosts are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\\nSales and Mark eting\\nSales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related\\nexpenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other\\nprograms. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $904 million, $1.5 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal\\nyears 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nCompensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured\\nat the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance\\nperiod.

Certain\\nincome and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary\\ndifferences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely\\nthan not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\nFinancial Instr uments\\nInvestments\\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash\\nequivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of\\ngreater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with\\nmaturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable\\nsecurities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.\\nDebt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification\\nmethod. Changes in fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other comprehensive income. F air value is\\ncalculated based on publicly available market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of an investment\\nexceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the\\nextent to which the fair value is less than cost. T o determine credit losses, we employ a systematic methodology that considers\\navailable quantitative and qualitative evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of,\\nand business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell\\nthe security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense),\\nnet and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, we may incur\\nfuture impairments.\\nEquity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable\\nfair values are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or\\nimpairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). W e perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an\\nimpairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are\\nrecorded in other income (expense), net.\\nDerivatives\\nDerivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair\\nvalue of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net with\\noffsetting gains and losses on the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of\\neffectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported as a component of other\\ncomprehensive income and subsequently recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and\\nlosses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.\\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in\\nother income (expense), net.\\nFair V alue Measur ements\\nWe account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to\\nwhich inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market. W e categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of\\nthese three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are:\\nLevel 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments\\ninclude U.S. government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and liabilitiesAnnual R epor t 2023\\nhome   8/3/24, 12:09 PM Microsoft 2023 Annual Report\\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/ 41/68'), Document(metadata={'source': 'documents\\\\Microsoft 2023 Annual Report.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='include those actively traded on exchanges.\\nLevel 2  – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar\\ninstruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e.g. the Black-Scholes model) for which all\\nsignificant inputs are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of\\nthe assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present\\nvalue using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and\\nspot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency securities, foreign\\ngovernment bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2\\nderivative assets and liabilities include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts.\\nLevel 3  – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants\\nwould use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option\\npricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and\\nbonds, municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge.\\nUnobservable inputs used in the models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.\\nWe measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments\\nare determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market\\ncomparables, and discounted cash flow projections.\\nOur other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\\nInventories\\nInventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and\\nmanufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price less\\nestimated costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. W e regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase\\ncommitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying\\nvalue, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.\\nProper ty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the\\nshorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are\\ngenerally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years;\\nbuildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10\\nyears. Land is not depreciated.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“R OU”) assets,\\nother current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and\\nequipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make\\nlease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease R OU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the\\npresent value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use our\\nincremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease\\npayments at commencement date. The operating lease R OU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease\\nincentives. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise\\nthat option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain\\nequipment leases, such as vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for\\ncertain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease R OU assets and liabilities.\\nGoodwill\\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one level below an operating segment) on an\\nannual basis (May 1) and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the\\nfair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.\\nIntangible Assets\\nOur intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period of\\nbenefit, ranging from one to 20 years. W e evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or\\ncircumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.\\nNOTE 2 — EARNINGS PER SHARE\\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during\\nthe period.

W e assumed responsibility for these\\nclaims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine\\nof these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are stayed. In a separate\\n2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular\\nhandsets that operate within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FC C Guidelines”)\\nare pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FC C Guidelines or were\\nmanufactured before the FC C Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the\\nscience and testing around emission guidelines.\\nIn 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis\\nof flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion to exclude the\\nplaintiffs’ general causation experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\\nchallenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting\\nthe standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard.\\nThe plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the court. A hearing on general causation\\ntook place in September of 2022. In April of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of plaintiffs’ experts\\nthat cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying.\\nIrish Data Pr otection Commission Matt er\\nIn 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s\\ntargeted advertising practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data Protection R egulation (“GDPR”).\\nMicrosoft cooperated throughout the period of inquiry.
